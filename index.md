###  Neural Networks Project
## Project Description
For my project, I hope to use neural networks to create an app that converts handwritten text to typed text. I chose this project because I wanted to create a product that I would actually use and find valuable. This product would help save me, my classmates, and my professors time. This would help people who have bad handwriting and have trouble reading it later. This project could also help convert whiteboard notes to text for students who take slow notes or even for students in quarantine.

I plan to accomplish this by using image classification to identify letters, punctuation, and spaces so that it can be converted to text. I would want to start with English, but eventually make it accessible to other languages. I also think with more time it would be interesting to have the app be able to distinguish between text and images/diagrams so that it can include images and diagrams separately in the notes as pictures. 

## Software
As states above, I plan to accomplish my project by using image classification to identify letters, punctuation, and spaces so that handwritten text can be converted to electronic text. Since there is still a lot that I do not know about Neural Networks, I am not sure exactly how I would tackle this project. I anticipate there being problems identifying spaces and therefore distinguishing between beginning and endings of words. 

In order to use image classification well, I would have to provide the program with a diverse set of handwritting samples. This would have to include capitlized text and cursive. 

## Goals 
1. Create and gather dataset of handwritting 
2. Traing a Neural Network to recgonize the different letters and punctuation in handwritting 
3. Train a Neural Network to recgonize when words end and begin
4. Map recgonized letters and punctuatuon to electronic text output 
5. Test the program against different writing samples
